<h1 align="center" id="title">Library Management System</h1>

<p id="description">A robust web application designed to streamline library operations with a secure and scalable architecture. The system leverages FastAPI for a high-performance backend Next.js for an intuitive and responsive frontend and MongoDB for efficient data management. It incorporates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained user permissions secure authentication with JWT/OAuth and advanced security measures like input validation and encrypted data handling. Key functionalities include book and user management activity tracking and a borrow-return system providing an end-to-end solution for modern library needs.</p>
